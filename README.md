WordPress richtext format button to autolink Cathopedia articles

In earlier versions of WordPress, shortcodes were widely used for adding dynamic or automated content to an article or a page.

Ever since the advent of the "Gutenberg" Block Editor, shortcodes have lost their meaning in life.
The same goals can be achieved in a visual manner extending the Block Editor with new block types,
or in this case with a simple format button on the toolbar.

This plugin adds a format button with an ICTHUS fish icon.
The purpose of this button is to transform the selected text into a link to a page on Cathopedia with the same title as the selected text.
